# openCDD
The official repository of OpenCDD Bot. A bot by the community for the community.
Note: this bot as well as this code belongs to the Coin Des DÃ©veloppeurs server and community.
**This bot is written in RUST using [serenity](https://crates.io/crates/serenity).**

This bot account has only a few channels to talk, but it can be useful to debug. **Any abuse will be punished.**
When your code is ready, you can create a branch here and a ticket to the staff on the server, so we can think to push your code to the main OpenCDD bot hosted by us.
